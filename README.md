Important: Any shared libraries made with CGO will inherit any design choices of the Go runtime as well as drawbacks involved with interoperability. This seems to hold true for Rust, Swift, and to my surprise C++. As such, it makes more sense to either make an ldap service to interface with libnss-ldapd/sssd, or write libnss modules in C. Fixing and using go-libnss comes with drawbacks that will likely set your project up for failure.

# go-libnss-etcd
A libnss module and commands for managing additional users in `etcd`.

Note: At this time go-libnss-etcd works. The `nss-etcd-passwd` needs rigorous testing before it should ever go into production, because it is expected to always run as root. If you need that command, I recommend not setting the sticky bit for it to run as root in production, so that unprivileged users can run it. 

To get this package run:
```
go get -d github.com/protosam/go-libnss-etcd
```

# Simple Installation (Quick and Lazy)
Do the steps in the section `Locking Down ETCD`  
Do the steps in the section `Configuration Files`  
Run this as root:
```
# make && make install
```
Do the showing the example of configuring `/etc/nsswitch.conf` mentioned in the `Installing libnss_etcd.so.2` section.

After that you should be done. Just use the management tools documented in the last section of this README.

# Building Manually
There are 3 parts to compile this. There is the `libnss_etcd.so.2` shared library, the `nss-etcd-manage` CLI tool, and the `nss-etcd-passwd` CLI tool.

Compiling `libnss_etcd.so.2` is done by running the following command.
```
CGO_CFLAGS="-g -O2 -D __LIB_NSS_NAME=etcd" go build --buildmode=c-shared -o libnss_etcd.so.2 libnss-etcd.go etcd-db.go
```

The `nss-etcd-manage` CLI tool is used for managing users and groups in etcd. Compiling it is done by running:
```
go build -o nss-etcd-manage etcd-db.go nss-etcd-manage.go
```

Lastly is `nss-etc-passwd` for user password changes. It is compiled by running
```
go build -o nss-etcd-passwd etcd-db.go nss-etcd-passwd.go
```

# Installation
The install process is broken up into a few parts. You need to lock down your `etcd` keystore a bit, putting compiled files into place, and setting the sticky bit on `nss-etc-passwd`. Just do the following after compiling the binaries and you should be in business.

Additional note: `selinux` does not like allowing these users to login through SSH. I personally just disable selinux, because it causes a lot of unneccessary hassle. However if you can't disable `selinux` because you need the additional security it provides, please do troubleshoot this and share with me in the issues section what steps I need to add for setting contexts and whatnot. I'll be happy to add them to this readme.

## Locking Down ETCD
You will need to set password for root, enable authentication, create a read-only and read-write role for `go-libnss-etcd`. Below are some dead simple copy/pasta you can use. The variables you're exporting should probably be added to your `.bashrc` file for easy use later.

```
# export ETCDCTL_API=3
# etcdctl user add 'root:YOUR_ROOT_ETCD_PASSWORD_HERE'
# export ETCDCTL_USER='root:YOUR_ROOT_ETCD_PASSWORD_HERE'
# etcdctl user add nss-ro:YOUR_READ_ONLY_PASSWORD_HERE
# etcdctl user add nss-rw:YOUR_READ_WRITE_PASSWORD_HERE
# etcdctl role add nss-ro
# etcdctl role add nss-rw
# etcdctl role grant-permission nss-ro --prefix=true read /etc/passwd
# etcdctl role grant-permission nss-ro --prefix=true read /etc/group
# etcdctl role grant-permission nss-rw --prefix=true readwrite /etc/passwd
# etcdctl role grant-permission nss-rw --prefix=true readwrite /etc/group
# etcdctl role grant-permission nss-rw --prefix=true readwrite /etc/shadow
# etcdctl user grant-role nss-ro nss-ro
# etcdctl user grant-role nss-rw nss-rw
```

## Configuration Files
For non-privileged users `libnss-etcd.so.2` and `nss-etcd-passwd` will use `/etc/nss-etcd.conf`. The contents of this config file is in JSON format with the following data:
```
{
	"Endpoints": ["http://localhost:2379"],
	"DialTimeout": 2,
	"Username": "nss-ro",
	"Password":	"YOUR_READ_ONLY_PASSWORD_HERE",
	"MinXID": 2000
}
```

For privileged users like root, `libnss-etcd.so.2`, `nss-etcd-manage`, and `nss-etcd-passwd` will use `/etc/nss-etcd-root.conf`. The contents of this config file is in JSON format with the following data:
```
{
	"Endpoints": ["http://localhost:2379"],
	"DialTimeout": 2,
	"Username": "nss-rw",
	"Password":	"YOUR_READ_WRITE_PASSWORD_HERE",
	"MinXID": 2000
}
```

After you've created the config files, the next step is to set permissions on the config files with appropriate read/write access:
```
# chmod u=rw,g=r,o=r /etc/nss-etcd.conf
# chmod u=rw,g=,o= /etc/nss-etcd-root.conf
```

## Installing Binaries
Copy `nss-etcd-manage` to `/sbin/` and `nss-etcd-passwd` to `/bin`.
You will need to set the sticky bit for `nss-etcd-passwd` to run as root so it can update the shadow entries when users want to update their passwords:
```
cp nss-etcd-manage /sbin/
cp nss-etcd-passwd /bin/
chown root:root /bin/nss-etcd-passwd /sbin/nss-etcd-manage
chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx /bin/nss-etcd-manage
chmod u=rwxs,g=rx,o=rx /bin/nss-etcd-passwd
```

## Installing libnss_etcd.so.2
Copy `libnss_etcd.so.2` to `/lib64/` or where ever your shared library directory is.
Update `/etc/nsswitch.conf` to contain `etcd` like so:
```
passwd:     files etcd sss
shadow:     files etcd sss
group:      files etcd sss
```
And now the users stored in `etcd` should be visible to the system.

# Management Tools
`nss-etcd-manage` is used to manage user and group entries. 

To add new users to libnss-etcd:
```
# nss-etcd-manage user add --username="testuser" --password="password" --uid=2000 --gid=2000 --comment="Is stored in etcd." --homedir="/home/testuser" --shell="/bin/bash"
```

To delete existing users from libnss-etcd
```
# nss-etcd-manage user delete --username="testuser"
```

To add a new group to libnss-etcd:
```
# nss-etcd-manage group add --groupname="testguys" --gid=2001
```

To delete a group from libnss-etcd:
```
# nss-etcd-manage group delete --groupname="testguys"
```

To add a member to a group in libnss-etcd:
```
# nss-etcd-manage group add-member --groupname="testguys" --username="testuser"
```

To remove a member from a group in libnss-etcd:
```
# nss-etcd-manage group remove-member --groupname="testguys" --username="testuser"
```

`nss-etcd-passwd` is used to change passwords for users.

As the root user you can run the following to change a user's password. Only root can user the --username flag.
```
# nss-etcd-passwd --username john --password new_password
```

As a libnss-etcd user, you can run the following to change your own password.
```
# nss-etcd-passwd --password new_password
```
